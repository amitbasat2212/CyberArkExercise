#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

good = True
_var = "hello" 

#separate words using underscore _:
user_name = "momo" 

#Functions should be written all lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability:
def calculate():
  pass
def add_item():
  pass 

#Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
#class WordCounter()

# Single Leading Underscore: _var
# Single Trailing Underscore: var_
# Double Leading Underscore: __var
# Double Leading and Trailing Underscore: __var__
# Single Underscore: _


# The double underscore prefix, is not just a name convention, it affect the interpreter.
# This name pattern helps us create unique class properties (functions or variables) that cannot be overridden.
